# testing_siteleaf
Another repo built to test and learn a new cms- Siteleaf

I may come back and add to the README file after I test Siteleaf for a few days. I don't want to say I favor one over another. But ease of use is going to Siteleaf right now. But I haven't connected a custom domain or done anything else outside of the free Developer Plan. Feb 17, 2026

Have yet to see the site function since it's been built. Constant 404 page from Github. Feb 18, 2026
