# testing_siteleaf
Another repo built to test and learn a new cms- Siteleaf

I may come back and add to the README file after I test Siteleaf for a few days. I don't want to say I favor one over another. But ease of use is going to Siteleaf right now. But I haven't connected a custom domain or done anything else outside of the free Developer Plan. Feb 17, 2026
